# 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N ¡Á 3 Grid

This problem is quite easy if you discover more.
Once the first layer is determined, the possible next layer is determined.

My approach is to consider 12 different case of one layer. But it is not necessary.

You can divide 12 cases into 2 groups. The first group is of form 121, the second is of form 123.
They have 6 cases for 121, and 6 cases for 123.

And for cases inside same group, the next layer is the same because three color has equal status. You 123 or 213 is the same.

So, generalize anytime you can. Never just use a precise but time-consuming categorization technique.
